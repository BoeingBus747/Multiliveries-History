# Geofs-Multiliveries
A livery addon authored by Spice 9 and Ariakim Taiyo:
Adds over 100 new liveries to the simulator.
Features new liveries for the A319-100, A320neo, 787-10, 787-9, P8, and the 737-MAX 8.
Partial multilayer visibility is supported; Only those who are using this addon will see custom liveries.
There are "helper tags" added to supported airframes: look for the "[Mulitliveries Frame]" tag at the end of the aircraft name to see which are compatible.

Here is a good tutorial by Aerospace Rules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLFyEEJZKbQ

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:

Download the plain texture maps from the source code,
Use an image editor to paint your livery onto the aircraft,
Export the texture file in the original resolution (IMPORTANT!),
Join our Discord server and submit your livery in the respective channel. We are looking into alternatives for those without Discord. For now though, DO NOT use the issues page to submit liveries.

Regarding 3.3 Support:
3.3 is now the official GeoFS version, and as so this addon has been updated to work on 3.3!
